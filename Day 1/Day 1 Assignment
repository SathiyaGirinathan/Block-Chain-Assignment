ASSIGNMENT-1

QUESTION-1
WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF BLOCKCHAIN?
ANS :Blockchain is decentralized, distributed, immutable ledger technology which records each and every records of transaction of every peer in which each 
candidate is able to access, verify, and send the transaction to others.
    

 QUESTION-2
WHAT IS CORE PROBLEM BLOCKCHAIN TRY TO SOLVE ?
ANS :blockchain solves many problem in various industries. The main core problem which blockchain solves and give is TRUST which even Internet does not provide.
Yes, blockchain is immutable and each and eavery transaction which it adds in block is verified by miners and cryptographic algorithms which solves the problem of trust.

QUESTION-3
WHAT ARE FEW FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN WILL GIVE YOU?
ANS : There are many features and real life use cases of blockchain such as:-
1.	DECENTRALIZED :-  there is no central authorative domain who controls it, all the peers in network have same access features and it have multiple authorative domains.
2.	DISTRIBUTED :- blockchain maintains the universal ledger which is distributed across each node in network and they maintain its copy.
3.	COLLABORATION :- It allow each party to have transaction directly with each-other without having any third-party dependency.
4.	RELIABILITY :- Blockchain avoids the problem of double spending and accelerate the rate of transactions.


QUESTION-4
WHAT ALL THINGS DOES A BLOCK CONTAIN?
ANS :Block contain many things like:-
•	Block header
•	Hash
•	Previous block hash
•	Nonce
•	Merkle tree root
•	Timestamp

QUESTION-5
HOW A VERIFIABILITY OF BLOCKCHAIN HAS BEEN ATTAINED?
ANS :BLOCKCHAIN verifiability is done with the help of miners and new block is added to blockchain.
Whenever the new transaction happens in network it goes to miners and miners check its verifiability through the cryptography and by solving the mathematical puzzle and
whoever solves it first broadcast the transaction to network and transaction is added in blockchain.
